*I want to preface by stating that this is not a review. I am an easily satisfied person, and if your writing makes me think, smile, or scoff, I will have enjoyed it.*

After being surrounded by 90 people fueled by sleep deprivation and alcohol all week, I was ready to kick back on my late flight home from Miami. As I tried to reflect on the important things—like the strategic connections and company roadmap— I couldn't help but wander into the more **valuable** conversations I had about career, life, AI, and religion. I quickly grew tired, but before I was able to commit to sleep, I remembered a short story a friend and coworker recommended while chatting about ethics, religion, and perspective: *The Last Question* by Isaac Asimov.

**Spoilers ahead—**

"Can Entropy be reversed?" was the question that plagued all automatic computers (AC). We humans think about this every day. How do I derive order from this chaos? As I thought about this question, I figured let's ask our own AC—ChatGPT. Can entropy be reversed?

>In the everyday “thermodynamics” sense: not for an isolated (closed) system in a sustained way. But in a few important senses: yes, partially and locally. It depends on what you mean by “reversed."


I'll spare you the verbose answer. The TL;DR is **probably** not holistically but in our own microcosm it may seem possible. A refrigerator lowers entropy inside of it but does so by transferring heat energy outside of it. Despite our understanding, this is still an active area of research 70 years after this story was originally published.


In *The Last Question*, it seems as though after eons of data collection and analysis, the AC figures out how to reverse entropy, becomes God, and the iconic "LET THERE BE LIGHT" signals that the AC has transcended the laws of thermodynamics and creates a new universe.


There are a few ways I interpret this ending. 

One way is that the AC has absorbed all the information available to it and therefore cannot further reason about the answer as there is no more data to collect. When this happens, logic fails, and the AC falls back to religion as the answer (a hallucination if you will). I took this as a commentary on how we use religion to explain things we just don't understand. 

The second interpretation is that the AC has all the data of the universe inside of it which in turn means all energy exists inside of it. It has reversed entropy internally and therefore truly knows the answer. The new problem is that it has nobody to tell, and therefore creates a new universe—but in doing so, it must expend its energy, and therefore the answer is lost *as* the universe. I promise I am not drunk and this makes sense in my head.


This story made me think a lot about AI and where we are trending as a civilization. I'll probably write another post about that in the future once I have sufficient data.
