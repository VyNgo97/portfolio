After reading this, I want you to feel inspired to create or play video games.


Those who let themselves experience video games as they would a good book or movie understand that there is no experience more immersive. I often find people that disagree with me are those who see video games as a waste of time. But why? 


Video games are the closest thing to having super powers.

## My thoughts on fun
- Fun is learning and challenging. It is pushing yourself at the edge of your boundaries. This is why games get boring after you get OP or understand it fully.
- The best games of a small rule set that generates lots of possible outcomes. It is easy to be overwhelmed when a game has too many mechanics. But it can also be boring if a game doesn't have enough possible outcomes.
- People are on a spectrum. Not THAT spectrum. I mean to say that people have different capacities for things which leads to fun meaning different things to them.
- Fun != Pleasure 
    - Fun is a cognitive award for figuring something out
    - Pleasure is a sensory reward or dopamine hit
- If a game feels additive but empty it might indicate there is a lot of pleasure but not much fun (idle games)

### My recommendations
- Ghost of Tsushima
- Cyberpunk 2077
- Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
- Outerwilds
