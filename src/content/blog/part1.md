The leaves of the newly blushing maple trees rustle as though shivering from the brisk autumn 
breeze. The clouds cast a grey hue making the normally vibrant scene look muted. I reach out to touch the tree— feeling its scaly bark on my finger tips. I wil be the last one to ever feel it. As I pull my hand away, I catch the raindrops in the palm of my hand. It is as if the sky is mourning the soon to be passing of a close friend.

Even after 4 years in the construction unit I have still not grown used to tearing down natural life to replace it with artificial ones.
